## The steps to run our program are as follows...

## 1. In the command line input ```make```

## 2. In the command line input ```./prj2 num_Consumers```

##  3. The program will then output each thread's details as well as the total number of words.

## Issues we encountered when writing the code...
>### We had some difficulty developing the queue for the program as well as making it thread-safe. There was a little bit of difficulty involved in developing the text input mechanism as well but it was overcome after some research.
