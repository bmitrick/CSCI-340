# How to Build and Run hwk1.c
---

## 1. Be sure to have the Gnc Compiler installed.
** *If you do not have Gnc compiler installed, you can do so by running the command ```sudo apt install build-essential```.* **

## 2. Run the command ```gcc hwk1.c```.

## 3. Verify that the program has been properly compiled by using the command ```ls``` to view the files in the current directory and check to see if the file a.out exists.

## 4. Run the command ```./a.out ``` followed by the arguments you would like to add. This would be formatted as ```./a.out argument1 argument2 .... argumentN```.

## 5. If steps are followed properly, the program should run and print the addressed of each of the passed in arguments in the order in which they are given.
