## Issues we encountered when writing the code...
>### We had a great deal of difficulty figuring out where to start. It was much easier once the ball got rolling but it did take ~4 hours to just figure out where to start. Once we started writing the code, we did run into segmentation fault errors and things of that nature quite frequently due to the fact that we are rookies to C. Most of the difficulty was found in figuring out what to do and the nitty-gritty of actually executing it.
